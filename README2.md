## Introduction

ShortSpeak is a shorthand notation system that allows users to input complex commands and queries with minimal keystrokes. This repository provides an overview of ShortSpeak, its end-to-end approach, and its various components. Additionally, it includes instructions for installation and requirements, descriptions of publicly downloadable datasets, example use cases, and performance evaluation metrics.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Instructions for installation can be found in the [installation guide](./installation.md).

### Requirements
